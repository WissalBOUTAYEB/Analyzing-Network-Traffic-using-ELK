ðŸŒŸ Project Overview

This project focuses on setting up the ELK Stack to analyze network traffic. 

Key steps include:

Capturing network packets using tcpdump.

Processing PCAP files with a Python script (pyshark).

Indexing data into Elasticsearch.

Visualizing data in Kibana dashboards.

ðŸš€ Features

Packet Capture: Uses tcpdump to capture network traffic.

Data Processing: Python script to extract and transform packet data.

ELK Integration: Data is indexed into Elasticsearch via Logstash.

Visualization: Kibana dashboards for protocol distribution, top IPs, and traffic timelines.

Monitoring: Log monitoring for troubleshooting.
