# ELK_Project
This project successfully demonstrates the integration of various tools within the 
Elastic Stack to analyze network traffic captured in PCAP files. By leveraging 
tcpdump for packet capture, Filebeat for log shipping, Logstash for data processing, 
and Elasticsearch for storage and search capabilities, we have created a robust 
pipeline for real-time network analysis
